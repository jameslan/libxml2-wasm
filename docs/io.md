# Parsing XML with libxml2-wasm

libxml2-wasm supports parsing XML from either a string or a buffer.

Hereâ€™s an example:

```js
import fs from 'node:fs';
import { XmlDocument } from 'libxml2-wasm';

const doc1 = XmlDocument.fromString('<note><to>Tove</to></note>');
const doc2 = XmlDocument.fromBuffer(fs.readFileSync('doc.xml'));
doc1.dispose();
doc2.dispose();
```

The underlying libxml2 library processes MBCS (mostly UTF-8) only.
Therefore, when working with UTF-16 strings in JavaScript,
an additional conversion step is required.
Consequently,
{@link libxml2-wasm!XmlDocument.fromBuffer | `XmlDocument.fromBuffer`} is significantly faster than {@link libxml2-wasm!XmlDocument.fromString | `XmlDocument.fromString`}.
For more information, refer to the [benchmark](performance.md).

## VirtualIO and XInclude (Experimental)

[XInclude 1.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/xinclude/) is now supported.

When libxml2 encounters the `<xi:include>` tag and requires the content of another XML,
it utilizes callbacks to read the data.

With {@link libxml2-wasm!xmlRegisterInputProvider | `xmlRegisterInputProvider`},
an {@link libxml2-wasm!XmlInputProvider | `XmlInputProvider`} object with a set of four callbacks can be registered.

These 4 callbacks are
- `match`: This callback is invoked with the URL of the included XML.
If it returns `true`, the subsequent three callbacks will be used to retrieve the XML content.
Otherwise, other callbacks will be considered.
- `open`: This callback is invoked when the parser starts reading the included XML.
- `read`: This callback is invoked while reading the XML content.
- `close`: This callback is invoked when the parser has finished reading the included XML.

### Relative path

Sometimes, the `href` attribute of the `<xi:include>` tag contains a relative path.
In such cases, an initial URL can be provided to the parsing function so that libxml can calculate the actual URL of the included XML.

For instance, if the `href` attribute is `sub.xml`,
and the parent XML is parsed in the following call:

```js
const doc = XmlDocument.fromBuffer(
    await fs.readFile('/path/to/doc.xml'),
    { url: 'file:///path/to/doc.xml' },
);
doc.dispose();

```

The registered callbacks will be invoked with the file name `file:///path/to/sub.xml`.

### Node.js

For Node.js users who require callbacks for accessing local files,
the module {@link nodejs!} predefines {@link nodejs!fsInputProviders | `fsInputProviders`},
which supports both file paths and file URLs.
To enable this feature, either register the provider or simply call {@link nodejs!xmlRegisterFsInputProviders | `xmlRegisterFsInputProviders`}:

```js
import { XmlDocument } from 'libxml2-wasm';
import { xmlRegisterFsInputProviders } from 'libxml2-wasm/lib/nodejs.mjs';

xmlRegisterFsInputProviders();

const doc = XmlDocument.fromBuffer(
    await fs.readFile('path/to/doc.xml'),
    { url: 'path/to/doc.xml' },
);
doc.dispose();
```

# Serialize an XML

{@link libxml2-wasm!XmlDocument.toBuffer | `XmlDocument.toBuffer`} gradually dumps the content of the XML DOM tree into a buffer 
and calls the {@link libxml2-wasm!XmlOutputBufferHandler | `XmlOutputBufferHandler`} to process the data.

Please note that UTF-8 is the only supported encoding at this time.

Based on `toBuffer`, two additional convenience functions are provided:
{@link libxml2-wasm!XmlDocument.toString | `XmlDocument.toString`}  and {@link nodejs!saveDocSync | `saveDocSync`}.

For instance, to save an XML as a compact string, use:

```js
xml.toString({ format: false });
```

To save a formatted XML to a file in a Node.js environment, use:

```js
import { saveDocSync } from 'libxml2-wasm/lib/nodejs.mjs';

saveDocSync(xml);
```
